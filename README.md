The Pirate Intelligent Agent project had most of the code prewritten or provided except for the Q-Training Algorithm. The environment, the experience for replay, the build model, and play game were all code that 
was given beforehand. The environment code comes from TreasureEnvironment.py and includes the maze object as a matrix, code to reset the pirate position and to update the state based on its movement, code to get 
the rewards, track the states based off actions, and more. The experience for replay code was provided by the GameExperience.py file which the agent will use to learn by experience. The build model code and the 
play game code are included in the Jupyter notebook file which builds a neural network model and determines if the pirate can win a game, respectively. 

The Q-Training Algorithm is code I created myself to implement deep-Q learning. This code was created to help the pirate find the best way around the maze to find the treasure while maximizing its reward. The goal 
was to get a 100%-win rate after learning its way through the maze.

Computer scientists are designers, developers, and analysts that work with computers to solve problems using software and hardware. These scientists can create new applications, algorithms, and other technologies, 
and analyze data that solve problems.  Computer scientists’ work matters as it improves our lives and provides new opportunities.

I approach a problem as a computer scientist by researching the problem and determining how to break it down into manageable problems. Once I understand the problem, I can write pseudocode to develop an algorithm 
that might solve the problem. Then I create the algorithm, test it in different environments, adjusting it as needed until the problem is solved. 

As a computer scientist, one of my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization is to ensure there are no biases in my algorithms. I must protect the user’s privacy and maintain transparency 
between the user and the organization by communicating limitations and risks. Furthermore, I must uphold confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
